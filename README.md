## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a web page or app interface. It is a simplified design that focuses on the placement of elements like headers, text, images, and buttons â€” without distractions like colors, fonts, or actual content.

Think of wireframes as blueprints for your digital product.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the early stages of the design process. Here's why:

- **Clarifies structure and layout:** Helps designers and stakeholders understand the page structure and content hierarchy.
- **Encourages user-centered design:** Allows early testing of user flows and interactions.
- **Saves time and resources:** Makes it easier to identify problems before high-fidelity designs or development begins.
- **Improves communication:** Acts as a visual tool for discussing ideas with team members, clients, or developers.

Wireframes are often used before creating mockups or prototypes and are an essential step in the UX/UI workflow.
