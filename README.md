## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a web page or app interface. It is a simplified design that focuses on the placement of elements like headers, text, images, and buttons — without distractions like colors, fonts, or actual content.

Think of wireframes as blueprints for your digital product.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the early stages of the design process. Here's why:

- **Clarifies structure and layout:** Helps designers and stakeholders understand the page structure and content hierarchy.
- **Encourages user-centered design:** Allows early testing of user flows and interactions.
- **Saves time and resources:** Makes it easier to identify problems before high-fidelity designs or development begins.
- **Improves communication:** Acts as a visual tool for discussing ideas with team members, clients, or developers.

Wireframes are often used before creating mockups or prototypes and are an essential step in the UX/UI workflow.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes consist of several key elements that together create a meaningful layout for users and developers to understand the product's structure and flow.

### 1. Layout Structure

This refers to the skeletal framework of the page — the arrangement of headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

**Example:** A blog wireframe might show the header at the top, followed by a sidebar on the left and content on the right. This helps designers visualize the hierarchy and flow of information.

### 2. Navigation

Navigation includes menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, or any clickable elements that help users move through the site or app.

**Example:** A top navigation bar with links to "Home", "Services", "About", and "Contact" ensures users can access main areas easily.

### 3. Content Placement

This determines where text, images, videos, buttons, and other elements will appear on the screen.

**Example:** A product page might place an image on the left, product title and price in the center, and an "Add to Cart" button below — helping guide the user to take action.

### 4. Functionality

This refers to interactive components like forms, buttons, sliders, or search bars — even in basic form — to show how the interface works.

**Example:** A login wireframe might show fields for username and password, along with a “Log In” button, representing the flow for authentication.

Each of these elements contributes to making the final design user-friendly, intuitive, and functional.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can vary in level of detail depending on the stage of the design process. The two main types are:

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

These are basic sketches or outlines that focus on structure and layout rather than visual design or detail.

- **Appearance:** Often black-and-white, with placeholders (like boxes and labels).
- **Tools:** Paper sketches, whiteboards, Balsamiq.
- **Purpose:** Quick ideation, early feedback, exploring layout ideas.
- **Used when:** Brainstorming ideas, during early planning stages, or in team discussions.

**Example:** A wireframe showing a box labeled "Logo", another for "Navigation", and a big rectangle for "Main Content."

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes

These are more polished and closely resemble the final product. They may include actual content, detailed UI elements, and interactive components.

- **Appearance:** Clean, detailed, sometimes with real images, icons, or text.
- **Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.
- **Purpose:** Usability testing, stakeholder presentations, design handoffs to developers.
- **Used when:** Finalizing design ideas or preparing for prototyping.

**Example:** A detailed mobile app screen with proper buttons, form fields, icons, and spacing just like the final design.

## What Type of Wireframe Is This?

> _This README currently includes **low-fidelity wireframe concepts**, as it focuses on structure and foundational ideas rather than polished visuals or interactivity._

If a wireframe image or sketch is added later, use this section to explain whether it's low- or high-fidelity and why.
